    "developer": "I would like to say that I'm one of those people that have been programming since birth, but unfortunately I was 18 years too late.  I learned to program entering my Freshman year of college.  It was intimidating at first, but I picked it up fast and haven't looked back since.  Today, I am passionate about coding and have had multiple experiences working professionally. I will be starting my role as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in July 2020."
