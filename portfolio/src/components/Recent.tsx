                    I recently graduated from Iowa State University and completed my Bachelor's Degree with a major in Computer Science and a minor in French (2016 - 2019).
                    <br/><br/>What am I up to next? I will be heading to Seattle, Washington for my next role as a Software Engineer at Amazon!
